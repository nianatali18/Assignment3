# Assignment3

Assignment 3 (Linked Queue):
Based on what we know about linked lists, stacks, and queues, design a linked queue (a queue using a linked-list to store the data in the structure)
Design, implement, and test a Queue data structure that:
uses a linked-list to store values in the queue
has an enqueue method that will appropriately add a value to the back of the queue as an appropriate element
has a dequeue method that will appropriately remove an element from the front of the queue and return its value
Optionally has a peek method that returns the value at the front of the queue without removing it
Bonus if you also create an array based Queue!
Analyze the complexity of your implementations (at least the run-time of the add, remove, and peek methods).
(note that we will consider operations not having to do with the structure as O(1), even if they might be expensive operations in terms of real-time or space used)
(note that if you are not in class when we talk about Asymptotic Big-O notation, you can find tons of good examples online)
Tests: Be sure to include at least one test for each piece of functionality that should verify that your code is working!
Be sure to commit changes regularly to your git repo
Remember to submit a link to this project in Moodle to remind us to grade it!
Note: This assignment is partly to get you some practice with basic pointers if you have not used them much, to get you thinking about dynamically sizing containers, and to think about what might be efficient and what might be able to be improved.



#Design
##Goal:
Create a linked list that creates and stores values in a queue, also include an enqueue method that will add a value to the back of the queue as an appropriate element. Also include a dequeue method that will remove an element from the front of the queue and return its value and also make sure that it has a peek method that returns the value at the front of the queue without removing it. I will also analyze the complexity of my code and make sure that the run time of the add and peek methods are adequate. I will also include tests
